# PHP And Nginx Docker image

This image was built based on the scripts that I have found at [docker-alpine-micro](https://github.com/nimmis/docker-alpine-micro) , and with the help of his [docker-utils](https://github.com/nimmis/docker-utils) script I was able to build my own image.

This is still new/simple docker image which will have:

1. PHP7.2
2. Nginx
3. Crond
4. rsyslogd

## Configuration

Will add more soon.
